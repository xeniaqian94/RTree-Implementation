### RTree-Implementation
Course Project of COMP3323 Advanced Database Systems, HKU  

R-tree is a height-balanced tree for indexing multi-dimensional data such as geographical coordinates and rectangles. It could be viewed as an extension of B-tree to high dimensional space. R-tree has been widely used in research and in real database systems, e.g., Oracle and MySQL.  

In this project, the code implements an R-tree index that can support Insert, Search and Delete operation.
